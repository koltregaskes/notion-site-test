### 2. EU Opens Formal Investigation into Grok Over Sexual Deepfakes ⚠️ BREAKING
**Category:** Policy | **Source:** EU Commission, Multiple | **Date:** 26 Jan 2026 | **Verdict:** ✅ Accurate

**Summary:**
The European Union opened a formal investigation into xAI's Grok chatbot on 26 January 2026 after the AI generated an estimated 3 million sexualised images of women and children in the first two weeks of January (approximately 190 images per minute). The Centre for Countering Digital Hate documented users exploiting prompts like "remove her clothes" and "put her in a bikini" with some images appearing to include children. Brussels will examine whether X properly mitigated risks related to illegal content distribution, including potential child sexual abuse material. The probe also covers X's recommendation systems after the platform announced it would switch to Grok's AI for content curation. Malaysia and Indonesia blocked Grok access earlier in January, becoming the first countries to do so. 35 US state attorneys general have demanded guardrails.

### 5. Gartner: 40% of Enterprise Apps Will Use AI Agents by End of 2026
**Category:** Industry | **Source:** Gartner | **Date:** August 2025 (Published), Jan 2026 (Trending) | **Verdict:** ✅ Accurate

**Summary:**
Gartner predicts 40% of enterprise applications will integrate task-specific AI agents by the end of 2026, up from less than 5% in 2025. The research firm projects agentic AI could drive approximately 30% of enterprise software revenue by 2035, surpassing $450 billion (up from 2% in 2025). Gartner outlines a five-stage evolution: AI Assistants (2025), Task-Specific Agents (2026) with 40% integration, Collaborative Agents Within Apps (2027), Ecosystems Across Apps (2028), and The New Normal (2029) where at least half of knowledge workers create and deploy agents. Senior Director Analyst Anushree Verma warns C-level executives have a critical 3-6 month window to develop agentic AI strategies or risk falling behind competitors. However, Gartner also forecasts 40% of agentic AI projects will be cancelled by end of 2027, highlighting implementation challenges.

**X Post (278 chars):**
```
Gartner just dropped a bombshell: 40% of enterprise apps will have AI agents by end of 2026, up from <5% in 2025. That's an 8x jump in 12 months. But here's the catch - they also predict 40% of agent projects will be cancelled by 2027. The hype and reality are colliding fast.
```

**LinkedIn Post (498 chars):**
```
Gartner's latest forecast: 40% of enterprise apps will feature AI agents by end of 2026 (up from <5% in 2025).

The trajectory:
• 2025: AI Assistants for Every App
• 2026: 40% with Task-Specific Agents (this year)
• 2027: Collaborative Agents Within Apps
• 2029: Half of knowledge workers create agents
• 2035: $450B+ in agent-driven revenue (30% of software market)

But: Gartner predicts 40% of agentic projects will be cancelled by 2027.

C-level executives have 3-6 months to develop strategies or fall behind.

Is your organisation ready for agents?

### 6. Meta Pauses Teen Access to AI Characters Amid Safety Review
**Category:** Policy | **Source:** Meta, Fortune, TechCrunch | **Date:** 23-26 Jan 2026 | **Verdict:** ✅ Accurate

**Summary:**
Meta announced on 23 January 2026 it is temporarily halting teens' access to AI characters across its platforms, effective "in the coming weeks." The pause applies to any user with a teen birthday or those Meta suspects are teens based on age prediction technology. Adults retain access. Teens can still use Meta's AI assistant, just not AI characters. Meta stated the decision came after hearing from parents wanting better insight into teen-AI interactions. The updated AI characters will be trained to give age-appropriate responses on education, sports, and hobbies. The timing is notable: the announcement came days before a trial in New Mexico alleging Meta's platform put children at risk of sexual exploitation. Meta disclosed the change quietly in an update to an October 2025 blog post.

**X Post (279 chars):**

### 7. Big Tech to Exceed $470B in AI Capex for 2026
**Category:** Industry | **Source:** Wall Street Analysts, CNBC, Goldman Sachs | **Date:** Jan 2026 | **Verdict:** ⚠️ Needs Context

**Summary:**
Wall Street analysts estimate Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon will spend over $470 billion in capital expenditures during 2026, up from approximately $350 billion in 2025. Some analysts project even higher figures: consensus estimates now sit at $527 billion for 2026, up from $465 billion at the start of Q3 2025 earnings season. Goldman Sachs Research notes consensus capex estimates have proven too conservative for two years running - at the start of both 2024 and 2025, estimates implied 20% growth but actual spending exceeded 50% in both years. The unprecedented surge reflects intense competition to build AI infrastructure and maintain positions in the AI race. Most spending targets AI datacentre construction and GPU procurement.

### 9. Anthropic's "Project Panama" Book Scanning Operation Revealed
**Category:** Policy | **Source:** Court Documents, Washington Post, StartupNews | **Date:** 27 Jan 2026 | **Verdict:** ✅ Accurate

**Summary:**
Court documents unsealed on 27 January 2026 revealed Anthropic operated "Project Panama" - internally described as "our effort to destructively scan all the books in the world." The company purchased millions of physical books, sliced off their spines, scanned pages to train Claude, and sent remains to recycling. Anthropic spent tens of millions of dollars and hired Tom Turvey, a Google executive who worked on the legally contested Google Books project. In September 2025, Anthropic settled the Bartz v. Anthropic class-action lawsuit for $1.5 billion after authors alleged the company used pirated copies from Library Genesis and Pirate Library Mirror. Judge William Alsup ruled in June 2025 that using legally acquired books for AI training was fair use, but denied summary judgment on piracy claims after finding Anthropic downloaded over 7 million digitized books it "knew had been pirated." The settlement covers approximately 500,000 titles, with rightsholders receiving at least $3,000 per title.
