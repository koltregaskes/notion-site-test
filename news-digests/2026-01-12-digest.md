**Category:** Products | **Source:** TechCrunch | **Date:** 11 Jan 2026

**Summary:**
Google has announced a new protocol designed to facilitate commerce using AI agents. This represents a significant step toward enabling AI systems to conduct transactions on behalf of users, building on the agentic AI trend that dominated CES 2026.

**X Post (280 chars):**

Google announces new protocol for AI agent commerce. The infrastructure to let AI agents conduct transactions on your behalf is being built. Agentic commerce is coming.
```

**LinkedIn Post (500 chars):**
```
Google has unveiled a new protocol enabling AI agents to conduct commerce transactions.

This is significant infrastructure work that positions Google to be the backbone of agentic commerce - where AI systems purchase goods and services on behalf of users.

Coming after CES 2026's heavy focus on physical AI and robotics, this suggests the industry is building the rails for a future where AI agents are active economic participants.

The question isn't whether this happens, but who controls the protocol.

### 3. Retailers Test AI Agents Without Ceding Control to Google
**Category:** Industry | **Source:** AI News | **Date:** 12 Jan 2026

**Summary:**
Major retailers including Kroger and Lowe's are testing AI agents while deliberately avoiding dependence on Google's infrastructure. This signals a strategic push for enterprise AI independence and suggests tension between Google's agent commerce ambitions and retailer autonomy.

**X Post (280 chars):**
```
Kroger and Lowe's testing AI agents - but specifically avoiding Google's stack. Major retailers want agentic AI without platform dependency. The enterprise AI independence movement is real.
```

**LinkedIn Post (500 chars):**
```
Interesting signal from retail: Kroger and Lowe's are implementing AI agents while deliberately avoiding Google's infrastructure.

This isn't just about technology - it's about control. Major retailers want the benefits of agentic AI without becoming dependent on Google's protocols and data flows.

Expect more enterprises to demand "sovereign AI" - agents that work for them, not the platform provider.

The battle for AI agent control is retail's next big tech fight.

### 5. Google Removes AI Overviews for Medical Queries
**Category:** Policy | **Source:** TechCrunch | **Date:** 11 Jan 2026

**Summary:**
Google has removed AI Overviews from certain medical queries following concerns about accuracy and safety. This represents a notable pullback on AI-generated search results in sensitive domains - a sign that even Google is proceeding cautiously with AI in healthcare.

**X Post (280 chars):**
```
Google pulls AI Overviews from medical queries. Even the company pushing hardest on AI integration is pumping the brakes in healthcare. When accuracy matters most, AI caution wins.
```

**LinkedIn Post (500 chars):**
```
Google has removed AI Overviews from certain medical search queries.

This is notable because:
1. Google has been aggressive in pushing AI into search
2. Medical queries are high-stakes (wrong info = real harm)
3. It shows even AI leaders are drawing lines

The contrast with Anthropic's healthcare push is interesting - one company building medical AI infrastructure, another pulling back from medical AI in search.

Different use cases, different risk tolerances.

### 6. Indonesia and Malaysia Block Grok Over Deepfakes
**Category:** Policy | **Source:** TechCrunch | **Date:** 11 Jan 2026

**Summary:**

```

**LinkedIn Post (500 chars):**

This is significant:

- Southeast Asian nations leading on AI enforcement

As AI image generation becomes more powerful, expect more countries to take similar action. The question is whether platforms will self-regulate before being forced to.
