# About Kol

I'm Kol Tregaskes, a technology enthusiast and AI explorer based in the UK. I write about AI agents, creative tools, and the intersection of technology and daily life.

This site is my corner of the internet where I share thoughts, experiments, and discoveries. Most of the content here focuses on AI-assisted workflows, coding with AI agents, and building systems that make life more interesting.

## What I'm Working On

- Building AI agent workflows with Claude Code, Gemini, and other tools
- Experimenting with multi-agent orchestration
- Creating automated content pipelines
- Exploring the future of human-AI collaboration
